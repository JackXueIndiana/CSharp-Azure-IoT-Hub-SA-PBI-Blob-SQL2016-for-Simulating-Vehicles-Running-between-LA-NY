# CSharp-Azure-IoT-Hub-SA-PBI-Blob-SQL2016-for-Simulating-Vehicles-Running-between-LA-NY
As a continuous journey for our dream summer trip, we updated the running vehicle simulator which simulates vehicles starting from one of 171 exit points on the route (mainly along Interstate 15, 70, 76 and 95) and moving in steps to east (direction=1) until reaching one of the ends of the route and then immediately changing the direction toward the other end. The device will send out a JSON message to an IoT hub every 10 seconds. A message contains the DeviceId, EventDateTime, Latitude, Longitude and engine Temperature, representing the vehicle telemetry.
